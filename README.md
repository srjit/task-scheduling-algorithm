Implementation of Energy and Performance-Aware algorithms for task scheduling in a Mobile Cloud Computing Environment

The scheduler is built based on the ideas presented in this [paper](https://ywang393.expressions.syr.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/An-energy-and-performance-aware-task-scheduling-framework-in-the-mobile-cloud-computing-environment.pdf). 

The scheduler assigns an initial schedule based on a priority and allocates either a local/cloud CPU to all the tasks present. This initial assignment is later optimized to reduce the total power consumption of the system.
